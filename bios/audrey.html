    Vice President, Marketing &amp; Financial Development</p>
  <p><img src="../images/bio-audreywilson.png" width="189" height="260" hspace="8" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" />Audrey Wilson has devoted more than 20 years of her life at   Mathews-Dickey, where she currently serves as vice president of   marketing &amp; financial development.</p>
  <p>In the summer of 1982, Wilson, a recent criminal justice   graduate from the University of Missouri-St. Louis, worked at the Club   through the St. Louis Agency on Training and Development (SLATE)   internship program.  She remained a volunteer after the program until   the following January, when she was hired as a receptionist and game   room monitor.  </p>
  <p>Since then, Wilson has worked in various capacities at   Mathews-Dickey, including accounts payable, membership services and as a   program assistant and director.  Wilson says she enjoys watching the   generations of Mathews-Dickey members move throughout the Club,   especially when she sees former members enrolling their own children.    She serves as the liaison to the United Way of Greater St. Louis, a   Reach Out St. Louis resource director and oversees the day-to-day   operations of the Club’s financial and membership services.</p>
  <p>In her free time, Wilson enjoys volunteering at cultural   events such as the US Bank Jazz Festival and is active in the St. Louis   Christian Center.</p>
