  <p>On a summer afternoon in 1960 two men met in Handy Park after   baseball practice.  Martin Luther Mathews and the late Hubert &quot;Dickey&quot;   Ballentine, coaches of neighborhood baseball teams (the Knights and the   Arabs), shared a similar concern: a desire to keep young men on the   fields and off the streets.  This effort required the organization of   more teams, and two years later, Mathews and Dickey started a five-team   league.</p>
  <p>The number of teams grew as the men continued to meet in   Handy Park.  By this time there was a great need for a facility where   the young men could meet. Soon plans were initiated for a clubhouse in a   small storefront building at 4738 Natural Bridge (formerly occupied by   Bob Russell Sporting Goods).  The facility opened, attracting not only   more members, but also more volunteers.  The clubhouse became the   Mathews-Dickey Boys' &amp; Girls' Club.  As an important part of the   community, the Club provided growth and encouragement for thousands of   young men.</p>
  <p>Mathews-Dickey has come a long way since the first meeting   in Handy Park and subsequent storefront clubhouse.  The new facility at   Kingshighway and Penrose is equipped with an Olympic-size pool,   basketball gymnasiums, community meeting and music rooms, computer and   tutorial labs and administrative offices.  In 1982 President Ronald   Reagan dedicated the facility and declared it a model for the country.</p>
  <p>Two years later a multi-purpose outdoor athletic complex was   built in honor of Baseball Hall-of-Famer James &quot;Cool Papa&quot; Bell.  The   Mathews-Dickey baseball leagues and Bull Dog football teams call the   facility home.  Other Club and community-wide sporting events are also   held at the stadium. </p>
  <p>In 1986 the Club established its Girls Program, under the   support and direction of board member the late Charles Ruprecht and   advisor N. Evelyn Williams.  In 1989 a 19,000 square-foot expansion wing   was built with support from August A. Busch III, then chairman and CEO   Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc.; Charles F. Knight, then chairman and CEO   Emerson Electric Co.; and a dedicated staff and board of directors -   with leading support from Robert Grote, Jr. and the late Richard Casey.    The structure provided six learning classrooms, a dance room, a   teaching and demonstration kitchen, and the Jackie Joyner-Kersee   Auditorium.  The Girls' Program currently serves more than 10,000 young women in the areas of education, cultural arts, personal development and   athletics.</p>
  <p>Also in 1986 the Club introduced the &quot;<em>Stamp Out Illiteracy Through Learning Program</em>,&quot;   which provides individualized tutoring to youth needing help in math,   reading and language arts.  Since the program's inception more than   5,000 students have been served.  Today the <em>Volunteer Tutorial Program</em> works in conjunction with the St. Louis Public School System and other area school districts.</p>
  <p>In 1992 the late NFL Hall-of-Famer Walter Payton, a former   board member and consultant to Mathews-Dickey, helped the Club develop a   Computer <em>Literacy Instruction Program </em>to augment its existing   Tutorial Program.  Volunteer instructors with computer expertise provide   training to help the students become computer-literate.</p>
  <p>The <em>RBI (Reviving Baseball in the Inner Cities)</em> program is managed by Mathews-Dickey and endorsed by Major League   Baseball.  It is also supported by the St. Louis Cardinals LP and other   area corporations.</p>
  <p>In addition, Mathews-Dickey houses the city-wide <em>Motivation Vocation Preparation Program (MVP)</em>, which started in September 1991.  <em>MVP</em> deters gang activity by encouraging youth to become active in   extracurricular structured activities promoting self-esteem, goal   development and achievement.  Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. and Emerson   Electric Co. provided initial funding for the program.  The <em>MVP Program</em> is sponsored by Furniture Brands International, Inc. (formerly known as INTERCO INCORPORATED).</p>
  <p>In 2001 the Club officially added girls to the marquee,   hence becoming the Mathews-Dickey Boys' &amp; Girls' Club. The Girls'   Program Millennial Fundraising Campaign was co-chaired by broadcasters   Christine Buck and Wendy Wiese.  Insituform Technologies, Inc. made a   major financial gift and an in-kind contribution to replace all building   and marquee signage.</p>
  <p>In 2005 Ruprecht procured a $1 million Facilities Fund   challenge matching gift from the Jack Taylor Foundation.  Through the   support of area corporations, individuals and foundations, the Club   successfully matched the gift and completed $2.3 million in restoration   efforts. The project was led by Clayco, which completed work to the   Kingshighway, Union Athletic and stadium facilities in 2008.  Major   givers were Anheuser-Busch, AmerenUE, Dana Brown Foundation, Emerson,   Grote and Ruprecht.</p>
  <p>AmerenUE executive and Club board member Richard Mark joined   forces with Carole Buck, wife of the late Hall of Fame Broadcaster Jack   Buck, and Cardinals Manager Tony LaRussa to institute an &quot;<em>In the Footprints of Jack Buck</em>&quot; campaign.  With leading donations by Edward Jones and the William and   Laura Rand Orthwein Foundation, the walk of fame was completed in 2010.</p>
  <p>Mathews tapped former Board Member Bill Wilkerson to head up the new &quot;<em>Reach Out St. Louis</em>&quot;   initiative in 2009.  The program was developed to stem the drop out   rate at St. Louis public high schools Beaumont, Roosevelt, Sumner and   Vashon.  NFL Super Bowl Champion Coach Tony Dungy, San Francisco 49er   and former St. Louis Rams wide receiver Isaac Bruce, and Major League   Baseball Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith headlined the Community Launch.    Professional recording artist Jamie &quot;King James&quot; Dennis penned and   performed a theme song based on the Four Tops' hit &quot;<em>Reach Out I'll Be There</em>.&quot;</p>
