                        <li>Learn how to give in  ways that can actually &quot;give back&quot; for a time, providing extra income in  retirement years or to help fund educational expenses and other needs.</li>
                        <li>Add meaning to your gift  by using it to honor a special friend or loved one.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        That's  what effective gift planning is all about. We trust the following information  presented here will help you maximize the potential of your resources through  preserving financial security for yourself and your loved ones while funding a  worthwhile organization. <br />
                    </p>
                    <h3><a name="cash" id="cash"></a>Cash</h3>
                    <p>    Mathews-Dickey  commonly receives gifts online and in person in the form of cash, checks and  direct deposits.  Cash gifts can be  convenient for many people and are easily recorded through receipts and bank  records. It is important to save all receipts to assure maximum tax savings.</p>
                    <p align="center"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
                    <h3><a name="noncash" id="noncash"></a>Non-cash gifts</h3>
                    <p>    Many  Mathews-Dickey supporters choose to make their gifts in forms other than cash.  Popular examples include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Life  insurance policies</li>
                        <li>Real  estate</li>
                        <li>Retirement  plans</li>
                        <li>Securities  (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) </li>
                        <li>Other  items of value (jewelry, artwork, collections, antiques, automobiles, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>After  considering the properties you own, you may find giving something other than  cash to be an appealing alternative. Giving non-cash property may enable you to  make gifts while conserving cash for other uses and enjoying what may be greater  tax savings than those provided by gifts of cash.</p>
                    <p align="center"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
                    <h3><a name="realestate" id="realestate"></a>Real Estate</h3>
                    <p>    If  you have considered making charitable gifts as part of your long-term financial  and estate plans, you may want to consider ways a primary residence, vacation  home or certain farm properties can be used to make a future gift to  Mathews-Dickey while enjoying a number of current and future financial  benefits.</p>
                    <p>Through  a donation of a remainder in real estate, you can make a gift of your home or  other appropriate property now, while retaining the security of knowing you may  live there for the rest of your lifetime or&nbsp;other period of time you  determine.&nbsp; You continue to enjoy the full rights and responsibilities of  ownership.</p>
                    <p>Because  you are making an eventual gift for charitable purposes you are entitled to an  immediate charitable income tax deduction for the value of the remainder  interest of your gift. You continue to maintain the property, pay the taxes and  even receive any income it generates. Because you have provided for the future  ownership of the property, however, it will not be subject to the possible  expense and delay of probate. It will also not be part of your taxable estate,  possibly resulting in what may be significant tax savings for your heirs.</p>
                    <p align="center"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
                    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3><a name="willlivingtrust" id="willlivingtrust"></a>Will and Other Plans</h3>
                    <p> In  addition to filling an important role in providing for the future financial  security of your family and others, your will can offer a way to make  thoughtful charitable gifts as part of your long-range estate and financial  plans. It can be satisfying to know that a portion of your property will be put  to good use in the future.</p>
                    <p>A  gift made through a will can be convenient to arrange. A simple provision or  amendment prepared by your attorney at the time you make or update your will is  all that is necessary. Gifts included in wills are popular because they are  flexible, easy to arrange and may be changed with your life circumstances. </p>
                    <p><strong>Ways  to give through wills:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make  a gift of a specific amount. A gift of a particular amount may be designated  for general use or to fund a special need.</li>
                        <li>Provide  for a gift of a particular property. Real estate, stocks, and other items of  value are examples of properties that can be used to fund charitable bequests.</li>
                        <li>Designate  that a percentage of your estate be given to Mathews-Dickey through your will.</li>
                        <li>Give  the remainder, or residue, of your estate — that is, what remains after all  other bequests to friends and loved ones are satisfied.</li>
                        <li>Name&nbsp;charitable  interests&nbsp;to receive a bequest in the event other heirs are not there to  receive their legacies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There  is no limit on amounts deductible from federal gift and estate taxes for  charitable gifts made by will or trust, so no tax will be due on assets given  in this way. To plan a charitable bequest, inform your attorney of your wishes  and ask for advice regarding the best form for your gift.</p>
                    <p><strong>Other  ways to give through your estate</strong></p>
                    <p> Many  individuals have life insurance or retirement plans with significant balances.  In some cases, these assets total more than is needed for a comfortable  retirement, and could give rise to future income and estate taxes.</p>
                    <p>In  that case, it may be wise to consider using these funds to make gifts to  benefit Mathews-Dickey now or in the future. Contact your life insurance  professional or retirement plan administrator for ways to make gifts from these  resources today. A simple change of beneficiary form may be all that is  required to provide for a gift of life insurance proceeds or what remains in a  retirement account. As in the case of gifts through wills, such gifts can be  arranged to take place only if loved ones predecease you, or in the event of  other circumstances you specify.</p>
                    <p>Your  retirement plan administrator or your life insurance professional can also  provide more details upon request.</p>
                    <p><strong>Options  using bank and investment accounts</strong></p>
                    <p> Many  people have bank and investment accounts that they would like to leave directly  to family, friends or other charitable interests like Mathews-Dickey at the end  of their lifetime. This can often be accomplished using a &quot;pay on death&quot;  (P.O.D.) provision for a bank account or a CD or a &quot;transfer on death&quot; (T.O.D.)  provision for certain other investment accounts. Simply ask your bank manager  or officer of your financial advisor for the appropriate form. You retain full  ownership and access to the funds during your lifetime and the person or  charity only receives what is left in the account.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p align="center"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
                    <h3><a name="charitableannuities" id="charitableannuities"></a>Charitable Gift Annuities</h3>
                    <p> Charitable gift annuities&nbsp;are a very  flexible way to make charitable gifts to Mathews-Dickey. They can be designed  to provide a fixed income for life for you and/or others you choose. They are  easy to create and can be funded with gifts of relatively modest amounts.&nbsp; </p>
                    <p><strong>Here's  how a charitable gift annuity works:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You  transfer cash or other assets to Mathews-Dickey. This involves the completion  of a simple agreement and&nbsp;can normally be done by mail.&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>You  will receive fixed payments annually (or more frequently, if desired). The  amount of your payment is a percentage of your gift at the time your gift is  funded and will not change with interest rate and investment market  fluctuations.</li>
                        <li>You  will be entitled to an immediate charitable income tax deduction for a portion  of the amount used to fund your gift annuity.</li>
                        <li>A  part of each&nbsp;payment is received tax free for a period of time.</li>
                        <li>If  you would like, you can also choose to name another person (often a spouse,  parent or sibling) to receive payments with you, instead of you or following  your lifetime for the remainder of his or her life.</li>
                        <li>The  assets used to fund your gift annuity will generally be removed from your  estate for probate and tax purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p align="center"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
                    <h3><a name="charitableremainder" id="charitableremainder"></a>Charitable Remainder Trusts</h3>
                    <p> A&nbsp;<strong>charitable  remainder trust</strong>&nbsp;offers a way to make a future gift for philanthropic  purposes after first providing income for yourself and/or others you name.</p>
                    <p><strong>Here's  how a charitable remainder trust works:</strong> </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A  trust is drafted by an appropriate professional advisor.</li>
                        <li>Assets  are transferred to the trust to be managed by you or another person or an  entity you choose as trustee.</li>
                        <li>Payments  are made from the trust to you and/or others you name for life or other period  of time you determine.</li>
                        <li>You  are entitled to a federal income tax charitable deduction and may enjoy capital  gains tax savings in the year you create the trust. Amounts used to fund your  trust may not be part of your probate or taxable estate.</li>
                        <li>When  the trust ends, its remaining assets become a gift to one or more charitable  interests of your choosing. The gift portion is known as the&nbsp;<em>charitable  remainder</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There  are two primary types of remainder trusts: the charitable remainder annuity  trust which provides you with a level predictable income and the charitable  remainder unitrust which provides you with a variable income. Each is described  below.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>A gift with  predictable income</em></strong></p>
                    <p> A&nbsp;<strong>charitable  remainder annuity trust</strong>&nbsp;is a way to make a gift while assuring a  fixed, regular income. Income from such a trust can be a reliable income  supplement in retirement years. The payments received each year must be at  least five percent of the amount originally placed in the trust. You determine  the exact amount when your trust is created. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong><em>A gift with variable income</em></strong></p>
                    <p> Like  the annuity trust, the&nbsp;<strong>charitable remainder unitrust&nbsp;</strong>provides  for a gift that allows a donor to retain&nbsp;income for life or other period  of time. But unlike the annuity trust, the income from a unitrust can fluctuate  over time with the value of the assets placed in the trust.</p>
                    <p>You  determine the annual payment percentage when the gift is made. Each year this  percentage (at least five percent) of the value of the trust assets is paid to  you or others you name. When the value of the investments goes higher, more  income is received. The income will be less if the value of the assets  declines. If provided for in the trust agreement, additions can be made to a  unitrust and an additional tax deduction is allowed for part of any additional  amounts contributed.</p>
                    <p>For  those who would like to provide for an income that can grow over time, the  charitable remainder unitrust could play a welcome role in long-range plans.  Another benefit of charitable remainder trusts is the fact that no tax is  payable by the trust at the time investment gains are realized, making it  possible to enjoy increased income over time based on tax-free growth within  the trust. This can be especially attractive to those who  anticipate&nbsp;growth in investments over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Income for a period of time you choose</em></strong></p>
                    <p>    It  is also possible to establish a charitable remainder trust for a fixed time  period of up to 20 years. Such a trust may be useful if you would like to  retain income to meet your needs over a limited time frame. It is also possible  to create such a trust to provide income for one or more loved ones for a  particular term of years.</p>

                    <h3><a name="retirementplan" id="retirementplan"></a>Retirement Plan Gifts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many  Americans have taken advantage of tax incentives provided by Congress to  encourage saving for retirement through contributions to Individual Retirement  Accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s and similar plans.<br />
                        <br />
                        In addition to income tax savings at the time contributions are made to such  plans, the assets in the plans then build tax free over time for future  enjoyment.<br />
                        <br />
                        Amounts held in tax-favored retirement plans are typically not subject to  income tax until they are actually withdrawn from the plan by its owner or  surviving heirs.<br />
                        <br />
                        You may find that your retirement plan can also at times be a convenient  &quot;pocket&quot; from which to make charitable gifts to Mathews-Dickey each year.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Other  retirement plan gift opportunities</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p> If  you are over the age of 59½, and can make withdrawals from your traditional IRA  or other tax-favored retirement plan without triggering an early withdrawal  penalty, you may wish to make withdrawals from retirement plans in amounts  sufficient to fund all or a portion of your charitable gifts. Those over the  age of 70½ who would like to make gifts in excess of amounts that can be given  tax free or would like to give from a retirement plan other than a traditional  or Roth IRA may also wish to make their gifts in this way.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Although  you will be required to report the income on your tax return, when you itemize  your deductions, you are allowed a corresponding charitable deduction for your  cash gifts up to 50 percent of your adjusted gross income (AGI).</p>
                    <p>If  you are able to deduct the full amount of the gift/withdrawal, this can amount  to a &quot;wash&quot; for federal tax purposes and ensure these funds will, in effect,  never be subject to gift, income or estate taxes. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You  should seek assistance from your accountant or other advisor when determining  the optimum amount to give from retirement plan accounts under federal and  state tax laws.</p>
                    <p><strong>Avoid  Double Taxation</strong></p>
                    <p>    You  also may want to consider including charitable gifts as part of your plans for  the future distribution of any balances remaining in your retirement plans at  the end of your lifetime.</p>
                    <p>Because  they are included as part of one's estate at death the assets in tax-favored  retirement plans such as an IRA, 401(k), SEP, and similar plans can be subject  to federal and/or state estate taxes. In addition, when heirs receive the  balance of retirement plans after payment of estate taxes of up to 40 percent  or more, income tax will also be due — up to 39.6 percent or more — depending  on state income taxes and other factors. Thus, the combination of income and  estate taxes that could eventually be levied on retirement accounts may in some  cases amount to the bulk of an account's value.</p>
                    <p>Rather  than allowing retirement assets to be reduced by a combination of estate and  income taxes, you can direct that such assets be used to fund charitable gifts  from your estate. This can actually result in more assets being received by  loved ones than if retirement assets were left to family and charitable gifts  were made from other funds.</p>
