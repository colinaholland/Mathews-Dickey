                            <strong>About</strong><br />
                            The  Mathews-Dickey Boys' &amp; Girls' Club comes from humble beginnings, founded  under a shade tree in 1960 by two neighborhood baseball coaches, Martin Luther  Mathews and the late Hubert &quot;Dickey&quot; Ballentine. From a small storefront of 30  boys the Club has grown to serve more than 40,000 young men and women, ages  5-18, in a 50-mile radius throughout the St. Louis-metropolitan area. The Club  also acts as a meeting hub for various community, social and business  organizations and as an outreach resource center for youth from all walks of  life and socio-economic backgrounds.<br />
                            <br />

                            That's  what effective gift planning is all about. We trust the following information  presented here will help you maximize the potential of your resources through  preserving financial security for yourself and your loved ones while funding a  worthwhile organization. <br />
                        </p>

                            <p>    Mathews-Dickey  commonly receives gifts online and in person in the form of cash, checks and direct deposits.  Cash gifts can be convenient for many people and are easily recorded through receipts and bank  records. It is important to save all receipts to assure maximum tax savings.</p>
                            <p align="center"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                            <p>    Many  Mathews-Dickey supporters choose to make their gifts in forms other than cash.  Popular examples include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Life  insurance policies</li>
                                <li>Real  estate</li>
                                <li>Retirement  plans</li>
                                <li>Securities  (stocks, bonds, mutual funds) </li>
                                <li>Other  items of value (jewelry, artwork, collections, antiques, automobiles, etc.)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After  considering the properties you own, you may find giving something other than  cash to be an appealing alternative. Giving non-cash property may enable you to  make gifts while conserving cash for other uses and enjoying what may be greater  tax savings than those provided by gifts of cash.</p>
                            <p align="center"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
                        </div>

                            <p>    If  you have considered making charitable gifts as part of your long-term financial  and estate plans, you may want to consider ways a primary residence, vacation  home or certain farm properties can be used to make a future gift to  Mathews-Dickey while enjoying a number of current and future financial  benefits.</p>
                            <p>Through  a donation of a remainder in real estate, you can make a gift of your home or  other appropriate property now, while retaining the security of knowing you may  live there for the rest of your lifetime or&nbsp;other period of time you  determine.&nbsp; You continue to enjoy the full rights and responsibilities of  ownership.</p>
                            <p>Because  you are making an eventual gift for charitable purposes you are entitled to an  immediate charitable income tax deduction for the value of the remainder  interest of your gift. You continue to maintain the property, pay the taxes and  even receive any income it generates. Because you have provided for the future  ownership of the property, however, it will not be subject to the possible  expense and delay of probate. It will also not be part of your taxable estate,  possibly resulting in what may be significant tax savings for your heirs.</p>

                            <p> In  addition to filling an important role in providing for the future financial  security of your family and others, your will can offer a way to make  thoughtful charitable gifts as part of your long-range estate and financial  plans. It can be satisfying to know that a portion of your property will be put  to good use in the future.</p>
                            <p>A  gift made through a will can be convenient to arrange. A simple provision or  amendment prepared by your attorney at the time you make or update your will is  all that is necessary. Gifts included in wills are popular because they are  flexible, easy to arrange and may be changed with your life circumstances. </p>
                            <p><strong>Ways  to give through wills:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Make  a gift of a specific amount. A gift of a particular amount may be designated  for general use or to fund a special need.</li>
                                <li>Provide  for a gift of a particular property. Real estate, stocks, and other items of  value are examples of properties that can be used to fund charitable bequests.</li>
                                <li>Designate  that a percentage of your estate be given to Mathews-Dickey through your will.</li>
                                <li>Give  the remainder, or residue, of your estate — that is, what remains after all  other bequests to friends and loved ones are satisfied.</li>
                                <li>Name&nbsp;charitable  interests&nbsp;to receive a bequest in the event other heirs are not there to  receive their legacies.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There  is no limit on amounts deductible from federal gift and estate taxes for  charitable gifts made by will or trust, so no tax will be due on assets given  in this way. To plan a charitable bequest, inform your attorney of your wishes  and ask for advice regarding the best form for your gift.</p>
                            <p><strong>Other  ways to give through your estate</strong></p>
                            <p> Many  individuals have life insurance or retirement plans with significant balances.  In some cases, these assets total more than is needed for a comfortable  retirement, and could give rise to future income and estate taxes.</p>
                            <p>In  that case, it may be wise to consider using these funds to make gifts to  benefit Mathews-Dickey now or in the future. Contact your life insurance  professional or retirement plan administrator for ways to make gifts from these  resources today. A simple change of beneficiary form may be all that is  required to provide for a gift of life insurance proceeds or what remains in a  retirement account. As in the case of gifts through wills, such gifts can be  arranged to take place only if loved ones predecease you, or in the event of  other circumstances you specify.</p>
                            <p>Your  retirement plan administrator or your life insurance professional can also  provide more details upon request.</p>
                            <p><strong>Options  using bank and investment accounts</strong></p>
                            <p> Many  people have bank and investment accounts that they would like to leave directly  to family, friends or other charitable interests like Mathews-Dickey at the end  of their lifetime. This can often be accomplished using a &quot;pay on death&quot;  (P.O.D.) provision for a bank account or a CD or a &quot;transfer on death&quot; (T.O.D.)  provision for certain other investment accounts. Simply ask your bank manager  or officer of your financial advisor for the appropriate form. You retain full  ownership and access to the funds during your lifetime and the person or  charity only receives what is left in the account.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p> Charitable gift annuities&nbsp;are a very  flexible way to make charitable gifts to Mathews-Dickey. They can be designed  to provide a fixed income for life for you and/or others you choose. They are  easy to create and can be funded with gifts of relatively modest amounts.&nbsp; </p>
                            <p><strong>Here's  how a charitable gift annuity works:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>You  transfer cash or other assets to Mathews-Dickey. This involves the completion  of a simple agreement and&nbsp;can normally be done by mail.&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>You  will receive fixed payments annually (or more frequently, if desired). The  amount of your payment is a percentage of your gift at the time your gift is  funded and will not change with interest rate and investment market  fluctuations.</li>
                                <li>You  will be entitled to an immediate charitable income tax deduction for a portion  of the amount used to fund your gift annuity.</li>
                                <li>A  part of each&nbsp;payment is received tax free for a period of time.</li>
                                <li>If  you would like, you can also choose to name another person (often a spouse,  parent or sibling) to receive payments with you, instead of you or following  your lifetime for the remainder of his or her life.</li>
                                <li>The  assets used to fund your gift annuity will generally be removed from your  estate for probate and tax purposes.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p> A&nbsp;<strong>charitable  remainder trust</strong>&nbsp;offers a way to make a future gift for philanthropic  purposes after first providing income for yourself and/or others you name.</p>
                            <p><strong>Here's  how a charitable remainder trust works:</strong> </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A  trust is drafted by an appropriate professional advisor.</li>
                                <li>Assets  are transferred to the trust to be managed by you or another person or an  entity you choose as trustee.</li>
                                <li>Payments  are made from the trust to you and/or others you name for life or other period  of time you determine.</li>
                                <li>You  are entitled to a federal income tax charitable deduction and may enjoy capital  gains tax savings in the year you create the trust. Amounts used to fund your  trust may not be part of your probate or taxable estate.</li>
                                <li>When  the trust ends, its remaining assets become a gift to one or more charitable  interests of your choosing. The gift portion is known as the&nbsp;<em>charitable  remainder</em>.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There  are two primary types of remainder trusts: the charitable remainder annuity  trust which provides you with a level predictable income and the charitable  remainder unitrust which provides you with a variable income. Each is described  below.</p>
                            <p><strong><em>A gift with  predictable income</em></strong></p>
                            <p> A&nbsp;<strong>charitable  remainder annuity trust</strong>&nbsp;is a way to make a gift while assuring a  fixed, regular income. Income from such a trust can be a reliable income  supplement in retirement years. The payments received each year must be at  least five percent of the amount originally placed in the trust. You determine  the exact amount when your trust is created. &nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong><em>A gift with variable income</em></strong></p>
                            <p> Like  the annuity trust, the&nbsp;<strong>charitable remainder unitrust&nbsp;</strong>provides  for a gift that allows a donor to retain&nbsp;income for life or other period  of time. But unlike the annuity trust, the income from a unitrust can fluctuate  over time with the value of the assets placed in the trust.</p>
                            <p>You  determine the annual payment percentage when the gift is made. Each year this  percentage (at least five percent) of the value of the trust assets is paid to  you or others you name. When the value of the investments goes higher, more  income is received. The income will be less if the value of the assets  declines. If provided for in the trust agreement, additions can be made to a  unitrust and an additional tax deduction is allowed for part of any additional  amounts contributed.</p>
                            <p>For  those who would like to provide for an income that can grow over time, the  charitable remainder unitrust could play a welcome role in long-range plans.  Another benefit of charitable remainder trusts is the fact that no tax is  payable by the trust at the time investment gains are realized, making it  possible to enjoy increased income over time based on tax-free growth within  the trust. This can be especially attractive to those who  anticipate&nbsp;growth in investments over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p><strong><em>Income for a period of time you choose</em></strong></p>
                            <p>    It  is also possible to establish a charitable remainder trust for a fixed time  period of up to 20 years. Such a trust may be useful if you would like to  retain income to meet your needs over a limited time frame. It is also possible  to create such a trust to provide income for one or more loved ones for a  particular term of years.</p>

                            <p>
                                Many  Americans have taken advantage of tax incentives provided by Congress to  encourage saving for retirement through contributions to Individual Retirement  Accounts (IRAs), 401(k)s and similar plans.<br />
                                <br />
                                In addition to income tax savings at the time contributions are made to such  plans, the assets in the plans then build tax free over time for future  enjoyment.<br />
                                <br />
                                Amounts held in tax-favored retirement plans are typically not subject to  income tax until they are actually withdrawn from the plan by its owner or  surviving heirs.<br />
                                <br />
                                You may find that your retirement plan can also at times be a convenient  &quot;pocket&quot; from which to make charitable gifts to Mathews-Dickey each year.<br />
                                <br />
                                <strong>Other  retirement plan gift opportunities</strong>
                            </p>
                            <p> If  you are over the age of 59½, and can make withdrawals from your traditional IRA  or other tax-favored retirement plan without triggering an early withdrawal  penalty, you may wish to make withdrawals from retirement plans in amounts  sufficient to fund all or a portion of your charitable gifts. Those over the  age of 70½ who would like to make gifts in excess of amounts that can be given  tax free or would like to give from a retirement plan other than a traditional  or Roth IRA may also wish to make their gifts in this way.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>Although  you will be required to report the income on your tax return, when you itemize  your deductions, you are allowed a corresponding charitable deduction for your  cash gifts up to 50 percent of your adjusted gross income (AGI).</p>
                            <p>If  you are able to deduct the full amount of the gift/withdrawal, this can amount  to a &quot;wash&quot; for federal tax purposes and ensure these funds will, in effect,  never be subject to gift, income or estate taxes. &nbsp;</p>
                            <p>You  should seek assistance from your accountant or other advisor when determining  the optimum amount to give from retirement plan accounts under federal and  state tax laws.</p>
                            <p><strong>Avoid  Double Taxation</strong></p>
                            <p>    You  also may want to consider including charitable gifts as part of your plans for  the future distribution of any balances remaining in your retirement plans at  the end of your lifetime.</p>
                            <p>Because  they are included as part of one's estate at death the assets in tax-favored  retirement plans such as an IRA, 401(k), SEP, and similar plans can be subject  to federal and/or state estate taxes. In addition, when heirs receive the  balance of retirement plans after payment of estate taxes of up to 40 percent  or more, income tax will also be due — up to 39.6 percent or more — depending  on state income taxes and other factors. Thus, the combination of income and  estate taxes that could eventually be levied on retirement accounts may in some  cases amount to the bulk of an account's value.</p>
                            <p>Rather  than allowing retirement assets to be reduced by a combination of estate and  income taxes, you can direct that such assets be used to fund charitable gifts  from your estate. This can actually result in more assets being received by  loved ones than if retirement assets were left to family and charitable gifts  were made from other funds.</p>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                                    Your will should be reviewed periodically  and updated to reflect changes in your life — marriages, births, deaths,  financial gains or losses and your personal goals. Tax law changes may also  prompt a review of your plans.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Minor changes can be  accomplished with a codicil, a simple amendment to an existing will. More  substantial changes may require the drafting of a new will. Whether the changes  are minor or extensive, always consult with your attorney when considering a  revision, as handwritten changes may completely invalidate your will.
                                </p>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">The fees associated with drafting a will  can be quite reasonable, especially when you consider that its purpose is to  direct the distribution of property you may have worked a lifetime to  accumulate. Taxes and settlement costs that can be avoided with a well-planned  will can amount to many times the cost of preparing one.</p>

                                        There are a number of ways to combine  charitable gifts (also known as&nbsp;<strong>bequests</strong>) with your estate plans.  Gifts can take the following forms:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A  specific amount:&nbsp;You designate that  a particular dollar amount be transferred to one or more charities.</li>
                                        <li>Specific  property:&nbsp;You can designate  that a particular asset, such as real estate, artwork or other valuables, be  used to fund a charitable gift. Such a bequest should be worded carefully, as  the assets you own may change over time.</li>
                                        <li>A  percentage:&nbsp;A percentage of  your estate can be designated for charitable purposes, thus ensuring that your  gifts remain in proportion to other bequests.</li>
                                        <li>All  or a portion of the residue:&nbsp;You  can provide that charitable gifts be made from what is left after all other  gifts to loved ones have been fulfilled.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        Additionally, you may  include provisions for Mathews-Dickey through beneficiary designations of life  insurance proceeds or retirement plan assets that may remain at death.

                        <div class="faq-section-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>What is a gift annuity?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">A gift annuity is an agreement between an individual and  a charitable organization or institution. The donor transfers assets and  receives fixed payments for the rest of his or her lifetime and/or the lifetime  of another person.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em> Are there tax benefits?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Yes. There can be a combination of income, capital gains  and estate tax savings. We will be happy to provide you with a complementary  illustration.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>What determines the size of each payment?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">A number of factors, including the amount you place in  the gift annuity and your age at the time of the annuity’s creation.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Why does my age affect the rate of payment I receive?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Part of the amount you transfer is returned to you over  your life expectancy, which changes with age. Generally, the older you are when  your gift annuity begins, the higher your rate of payment.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Does that mean my payments change from year to year?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">No, your rate of payment on a particular gift annuity  agreement is set when your annuity begins. But if you give for additional gift  annuities — as many people do — the rate will generally be higher for annuities  in subsequent years.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong>What if I outlive my life expectancy?</strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">The gift annuity agreement requires that payments will be made for as long as a recipient lives.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Are the payments affected by interest rates or economic  fluctuations?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">No. Payments for a particular annuity are never lowered  or raised, regardless of changes in interest rates or the national economy. All  net assets of the charitable organization stand behind your agreement.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Exactly how can I benefit another person through a gift  annuity?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">You can designate a loved one to receive the payments  either with you, instead of you or only following your death. This can result  in a double gift — one to the charitable entity and another to a relative or  special friend.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Can I give stocks, bonds or other securities rather than  cash to fund a gift annuity?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Yes. If you give a low-yielding asset to fund a gift  annuity, you may also be able to increase your income since a gift annuity may  pay more and be taxed more favorably than other income. There can be additional  tax benefits if the securities have increased in value because you avoid the  tax on a portion of the capital gain in the property.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Will a gift annuity be part of my estate?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Not generally. If payments are made to you only, the  gift portion goes directly to the charitable recipient, thus avoiding estate  taxes and probate costs. Some gift or estate tax may be due if payments are  made to a person other than a spouse.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>How can I begin a gift annuity?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">A gift annuity can be created with a minimum of effort.  Contact Mathews-Dickey at (314) 382-5952, ext. 234 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:bwash-md@swbell.net">bwash-md@swbell.net</a> to request an exact illustration of benefits for a person  your age.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>What is the difference between an immediate gift annuity  and a deferred payment gift annuity?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Under the terms of an immediate gift annuity, you transfer assets to a charitable  organization in return for fixed payments for the rest of your lifetime and/or  the lifetime of another person, if desired. In the case of a deferred payment  gift annuity, the payments from the gift annuity start at a date you specify —  at least one year in the future.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em> Can I receive tax benefits?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Yes.  Because a portion of the amount used to fund a deferred payment gift annuity  will be used for charitable purposes, you are entitled to a federal (and  perhaps state) income tax deduction in the year you make your gift. When you begin receiving payments from the annuity, part of each payment can be tax-free  over your life expectancy.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>What determines the size of payments?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">The amount of  each payment is determined by how much is used to fund the deferred payment  gift annuity, the age of the future payment recipient(s) when the gift is made,  how long the payments are delayed and other factors. Generally, deferred  payment gift annuities pay higher rates than immediate payment gift annuities.  And the more time between the gift date and the first payment date, the higher  the annuity rate will be.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>What if I outlive my life expectancy?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Payments will  be made for as long as a recipient of payments lives.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Can I provide for another person through a deferred  payment gift annuity?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Yes. You can  designate another person to receive payments either with you, instead of you or  only following your lifetime. This can be a wonderful way to provide income for  a spouse or other loved one in the future.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Why may someone choose a deferred payment gift annuity  over one that makes immediate payments?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Delaying the  start of payments for a period of time may be especially appealing to people  who have not yet retired, but would like to supplement their future income once  they do. Example: Jane Doe, age 65, would like to make a special gift but is  also concerned about planning for her retirement. Through a deferred payment  gift annuity, she can make a gift now and receive an immediate tax deduction,  while postponing the payments for five years until her retirement, when her  need for the income may be greater.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em> Is the payment rate the same if more than one person  receives payments?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Annuity payments may be made for the lives of one or two persons. Because the combined life expectancy of two people is typically longer than one person’s life  expectancy, the rate of payment will be somewhat lower. Deferred payment gift  annuity rates are also affected by the length of the payment deferral period.  Rates for one and/or two people are available upon request.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>What assets can I use to fund a deferred payment gift  annuity?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">You may fund an annuity with cash, stocks, bonds or other securities. When you give  low-yielding assets to fund a deferred payment gift annuity, you are not only  entitled to an immediate income tax deduction, but you may also bypass or delay  capital gain taxes that would be due if the property were sold. (This special  treatment is not generally available if you establish a deferred annuity to  benefit someone else.)</p>

                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Will a deferred payment gift annuity be part of my  estate?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Not generally. If you are the only payment recipient, the assets used to fund your  gift annuity will not be a part of your probate or taxable estate. Some gift or  estate tax may be due if payments are made to a person other than a spouse.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Anyone who wants to make charitable gifts while  also preserving or enhancing personal financial security would be wise to  consider such a gift. Gifts designed to accomplish both of these goals can be  made in various amounts and are practical for people at a broad range of income  and wealth levels.</p>

                                    <p>Charitable gifts that also provide the donor with income can be made in several ways.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>One popular option is to make a charitable gift while retaining a fixed income. With this type of gift,  the amount of income you receive is determined at the time you make your gift  and remains the same from that point forward. This option is particularly  attractive for those who wish to plan on a definite amount of income that will  never change.</li>
                                        <li>Another option allows you to make a gift providing income that varies over time. Income you or a  loved one receives from this type of gift will fluctuate each year, depending  on the performance of the plan’s investments. This option provides an  opportunity for growth in income over time.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Payments are usually in the five to 10  percent range, depending on your age, the type of gift plan and other factors.  We will be happy to provide you with a complimentary illustration.</p>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Income can continue for your lifetime and/or the lifetime of whomever else you name. Or, in some cases, you may  specify that the payments continue for another period of time you determine, up  to 20 years. When payments are no longer needed or otherwise end, the remaining  funds are devoted to charitable use.</p>

                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>What assets can I use  to fund an income gift?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">You may fund a gift using a variety of assets —  cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate or other appropriate property.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Are there any tax  benefits as a result of such gifts?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Yes. Not only can you enjoy a generous tax  deduction, you may also minimize, delay, or completely avoid capital gain  taxes. Property (such as securities) that has increased in value while you have  owned it may be the smartest choice to fund an income gift. In this case, your  income tax deduction is generally calculated using the full fair market value  of the property at the time you make the gift. You also avoid paying capital  gains tax at the time the donated property is sold. We will be pleased to  discuss the best giving opportunities for your particular wishes and personal situation.</p>

                                    <p>A gift that results in additional income  for you may allow you to make meaningful gifts and, at the same time, help you  achieve personal goals, such as the following:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Educational expenses: If  you want to provide money for your children or grandchildren’s education, a  gift that features an income stream may be an attractive and tax-efficient  option. You can fund educational needs now or in the future while making&nbsp;a  charitable gift and enjoying significant tax savings.</li>
                                        <li>Supplement retirement  funds: If planning for retirement is high on your list of priorities, an income  gift can supplement other retirement plan income while also providing for a  charitable gift when you or a survivor no longer needs the income.</li>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">In its broadest sense, estate planning involves making provisions for the present and future management of the  property you have accumulated, and deciding how you want it distributed when  you no longer need it.</p>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Not necessarily. There are other ways to  distribute property.</p>

                                        <li>Joint ownership  arrangements allow you and others to own property together. Upon the death of  one owner, the property passes outside of probate to the surviving owner.</li>

                                        <li> Also review the  beneficiary designations of life insurance policies, IRAs and other retirement  plans, because your will and other plans may not affect their distribution.</li>

                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em> How can I make charitable gifts in my estate plans?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">You can make gifts from funds that remain  after you have first assured your family’s financial security. You can  accomplish this through a bequest in your will, a trust gift, naming Mathews-Dickey  to receive life insurance or retirement plan proceeds or other charitable  designations.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Is there a way I can enjoy tax savings and other benefits from charitable gifts now?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                                    Yes! With income gift plans, you can receive payments for life or another specified period while making a charitable  gift of assets that remain when you no longer require the payments. Income tax  deductions are allowed for such gifts when completed during your lifetime.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    If you fund income gifts with securities that have increased in value over the years, you can reduce  and/or delay capital gains tax on the assets. It can also be possible to  receive payments that are free of tax or taxed at lower rates than other  income. You thus enjoy the satisfaction of making a thoughtful charitable gift  as well as the benefit of attractive fixed or variable payments and immediate tax savings.

                        <div class="faq-section-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>Who should think  about giving life insurance?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                                    Since many people already have one or more  policies, gifts of life insurance can be a convenient option. Policies  originally purchased to provide for children, augment retirement funds, protect  a home mortgage, or provide for estate taxes may no longer be needed for that  purpose.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    If your children are  grown and financially independent, you have adequate retirement savings and  your home is paid for, one or more of your life insurance policies may now be  &quot;obsolete.&quot; You can make excellent use of such policies by giving them or the  proceeds they will eventually generate to Mathews-Dickey.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>How do I go about  making a life insurance gift?</em></strong></p>
                                <div class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                                    <p>You can choose from a variety of ways to  name Mathews-Dickey as the charitable beneficiary for a life insurance policy  you already own. The process can be quite simple:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Primary beneficiary: You  can name Mathews-Dickey to be the sole beneficiary of the policy.</li>
                                        <li>Co-beneficiary: You name  Mathews-Dickey to share in the proceeds with another charity or with others you  choose.</li>
                                        <li>Contingent beneficiary: Mathews-Dickey  receives the proceeds only if one or more other beneficiaries have already  passed away.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>These beneficiary  options may be easily changed if necessary, as your circumstances dictate. If  you wish, you may instead choose to make an immediate gift of a life insurance  policy by making Mathews-Dickey the irrevocable beneficiary and assigning all  rights or incidents of ownership to the Club. You may be entitled to an income tax deduction based on the value of the policy or premiums paid.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                                <p class="faq-opener"><span></span><strong><em>What if I still need  the life insurance policies that I own?</em></strong></p>
                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                                    Consider taking out a new policy and  naming Mathews-Dickey as owner and beneficiary. With this type of gift, the  premiums you pay may be deductible as charitable gifts each year. And, by  paying affordable annual premiums and reducing your taxes in the process, you  establish an eventual gift that may be much larger than you are able to make using other resources.
                                    <br /> <br />
                                    Another way to give  using life insurance is to purchase a policy to &quot;replace&quot; other assets given to  Mathews-Dickey. For example, if you make a charitable gift of cash or other  property, you might utilize the tax savings to purchase a life insurance policy  to benefit your heirs at death. The amount you gave to charity can thus be replaced by the benefits to your heirs from the life insurance policy.
                                </p>

                                        <li>Convenience: It is a  simple process to change the beneficiary or give all rights to a new or  existing policy.</li>
                                        <li>Tax savings: Significant  income, estate, and gift tax savings may be available by effectively planning  your gift using life insurance.</li>
                                        <li>Privacy: Unlike a  bequest in your will, a life insurance policy gift is not a matter of public  record.</li>
                                        <li>Flexibility: You can choose whether to name Mathews-Dickey as a beneficiary of a policy that is no  longer needed for its original purpose, such as payment of estate taxes. Or you  can purchase a new policy specifically for charitable use.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                        <li>Avoiding probate: Your life insurance gift can be put to work faster because the charitable recipient  receives the proceeds of the policy immediately without having to wait for the  estate to be settled.</li>
                                        <li>The full amount: Because life insurance gifts are generally not subject to estate taxes or probate  costs, Mathews-Dickey receives all the proceeds you designate.</li>

                                    If you have accumulated excess funds in a tax-favored retirement plan, or you are required to make mandatory withdrawals from such plans, you may find this option appealing.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Sharing these assets with charitable organizations like Mathews-Dickey as part of your retirement planning can be a wonderful way to continue a lifelong commitment to helping others.

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                                    If you are over age 59½, you are generally allowed to withdraw funds from retirement accounts  without triggering an early withdrawal penalty. You report the withdrawal  amount for income tax purposes, but are normally allowed an offsetting charitable deduction that can result in no income tax being due.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Special tax benefits may be available for those over age 70½ who wish to make charitable gifts from a  traditional or Roth IRA. Check with Mathews-Dickey or your administrator for more information.

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">You are generally allowed to eliminate tax on up to 50 percent of your adjusted gross income  (AGI) through charitable gifts of cash.&nbsp;Withdrawals from retirement plans  increase your AGI and, along with it, the amount of charitable gifts you can  deduct. But if your withdrawal exceeds certain amounts, you may cause other  income to be taxed at higher rates.</p>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">
                                    Consider using all or a portion of the required withdrawal to fund charitable gifts, thus reducing or eliminating taxes that would otherwise be due on the amount withdrawn.
                                    <br /><br />
                                    Many choose to avoid  this potential &quot;double taxation&quot; by using retirement funds to make charitable  gifts from their estate. Designating that charitable gifts be made with  retirement funds and leaving other assets to loved ones ensures that no estate  or income tax will ever be due on any remaining retirement fund balances.

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Yes. Funds remaining in your retirement accounts at death are considered part of your estate and may be subject to state and/or federal taxes.&nbsp;Additionally, any retirement  funds that remain after estate taxes may also be subject to income taxes.</p>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Yes. You can  designate that amounts you determine go to your loved ones before any  distributions are made to Mathews-Dickey. Or, you can provide for charitable  gifts only in the event your spouse or other heirs do not survive you.</p>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Yes, you may arrange  for one or more persons to receive an income for life or another period of  time. At the end of the term you choose, the funds remaining will go to your  specified charitable interest. This option can result in significant tax  savings while still helping to assure future financial security for heirs.</p>

                                <p class="faq-toggle-block" style="display: block;">Ask the administrator  of your plan for a Change of Beneficiary form. You can then designate one or  more charitable interests as a beneficiary to receive all or a portion of your  retirement plan assets under conditions you stipulate.</p>
