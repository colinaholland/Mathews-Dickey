    President &amp; Co-Founder</p>
  <p><img src="../images/bio-martinmathews.png" width="189" height="260" hspace="8" vspace="3" border="0" align="right" /> For more than 48 years, Martin L. Mathews has dedicated his life to  community service.  A champion for youth, Mathews has forged relationships  with business and community leaders, and developed innovative programs for  thousands of young people. Like Martin Luther King, Jr., Mathews believes in equal rights for all  and that everyone should work together - regardless of race, creed or  color - to achieve a safe, productive America.  In 1960, Mathews co-founded  the Mathews-Dickey Boys' Club under a shade tree in St. Louis' Handy Park.</p>
  <p> A former coach of the Mathews-Dickey Knights, Mathews led his team of 30  young men to victories on the baseball fields and in their schools and  communities.   Today, he is the full-time President &amp; CEO of the Club, which  annually serves more than 40,000 young men and women from the St.  Louis-metropolitan area.  Thousands of successful alumni have graduated from  the Club's programs.  In 2001, the Mathews-Dickey Boys' Club official became the Mathews-Dickey Boys' &amp; Girls' Club<strong>.</strong> Mathews led a Millennial Fund-raising Campaign to preserve the Girls'   Program for generations of young women to come by raising $1.5 million   over three years. In 2006, he successfully guided the Club to matching a   $1 million challenge from Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co-Founder Jack Taylor   to enable more than $2 million in restoration efforts to the Clubís   Kingshighway main, Union athletic and stadium facilities.  Mathews also   led a successful $1 Million Operational Reserve Campaign in 2007,   dedicated in memory of Hall of Fame Broadcaster Jack Buck, that was   bolstered by gifts of $500,000 by Edward Jones and $300,000 by the   Orthwein Foundation.</p>
  <p> A sportsman and humanitarian, Mathews influenced National League  Baseball Commissioner Leonard Coleman to establish a national day in honor  of Mathews' childhood hero, Jackie Robinson.  This program has heightened  awareness of the Reviving Baseball in the Inner-Cities (RBI) Program<strong>,</strong> and  enabled more young men and women to participate in the sport - both in   the  United States and overseas.  Mathews is the founder of the &quot;Earn and   Learn&quot; Program, a training effort that allows young people to earn money   as managers, coaches, scorekeepers and umpires.</p>
  <p> A guest of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Quanico, Va.  and several other major inner cities, Mathews founded the Mathews-Dickey  Motivation, Vocation and Preparation (MVP) program to address gang violence.  St. Louis is the only major inner-city in the nation that is riot-free - the  result of programs like Mathews-Dickey.</p>
  <p><img src="../images/mathewswithchildren.jpg" alt="Martin L Mathews" align="right" border="0" height="417" hspace="8" vspace="3" width="277" />In 1982, the Club was declared a model for the country by President  Ronald Reagan.  Its successful programs were recognized by the NBC Today  Show in the summer of 1994, and Vice President Dan Quayle and Supreme Court  Justice Clarence Thomas also visited the Club to applaud the St. Louis  Internship Program - which now operates in 36 cities.  The Club was also  featured in Anheuser-Busch's nationally aired commercial, which promotes the  Club's &quot;Three R&quot; concept - “respect, restraint and   responsibility.” Mathews-Dickey also was declared a 21st Century   Learning Center by the White House.</p>
  <p>    Mathews has received numerous local and national awards, including:   the  Amateur Baseball Hall of Fame; President's Council on Youth Opportunity;   St.  Louis Board of Education's Outstanding Community Service; the Washington  Times' National Service and American Century; National President's Award   of Excellence from Delta Sigma Theta, Inc.; the Missouri Athletic   Club's  prestigious Jack Buck Award and an honorary doctorate from Webster  University.  In 1975, the St. Louis Globe Democrat bestowed its   Humanitarian Award upon Mathews, and he was honored with the United   States Presidential Citizens Award by President Ronald Reagan in 1982.</p>
  <p> Mathews serves on the boards of the Missouri Athletic Club (MAC)  Foundation and Baseball Collegiate League.  A founding member of the Jackie  Joyner-Kersee Community Board, he helped launch a multi-million-dollar  fund-raising drive to build a youth facility for the young men and women of  East St. Louis, Ill.  He is a member of the Cote Brilliante Presbyterian  Church.  Mathews continues to work successfully with individuals from  diverse ethnic and professional backgrounds to improve race relations and  community partnerships in our society.<br />
