A champion for youth, Mathews has forged relationships with business and community leaders, and developed innovative programs for thousands of young people.</p>
    <p>Mathews-Dickey has come a long way since their humble beginnings. The new facility at Kingshighway and Penrose is equipped with an Olympic-size pool, basketball gymnasiums, community meeting and music rooms, computer and tutorial labs and administrative offices.  In 1982 President Ronald Reagan dedicated the facility and declared it a model for the country.</p></td>

Vice President, Marketing & Financial Development.
</p>
  </p>
  <p>To maintain the winning edge in the next century, the Marketing and Financial Development Department assesses the Club's programs and services. This includes internal auditing procedures that define our programs' primary goals and measure their results. Our Club-wide course catalog highlights the many activities available to our members. Special attention is paid to membership recruitment in the Girls' Program, which includes many cultural and leadership activities that complement our ever-popular Cheerleading. It is always exciting to see our 19,000-square-foot Girls' Program Expansion Wing buzzing with 10,000 young women engaging in positive activities. </p></td>

Washington, the Public Relations &amp; Special Events Department's comprehensive plan has generated increased awareness, financial and in-kind resources. The Club has been featured on every major television   network and in numerous local and national print and electronic media   outlets. We have conducted a record number of informational meetings,   speaking engagements and facility tours to educate the community about   the Club's activities. Affiliations with several local and national   organizations have increased our networking and improved our   professional development.<br />
<br />
The department works with a team of dedicated volunteers to   produce an event-a-month to raise much needed funds for our ongoing   programs. These community-wide events are the perfect platform to   recognize the efforts of our young people - many of whom have earned   jobs and scholarships.           Spreading the good news is essential to our continued growth and   success. What better spokespersons could we have than our young people?</p></td>

<p>Maintaining a 13-acre facility would not be possible without the in-kind donations of many dedicated supporters. We are especially proud of our young people's efforts with special gardening and clean-up projects. Due to the escalating costs of repairs, we are constantly seeking in kind and financial donors to keep our facility in tip-top shape.</p>

<p>Beautification is, indeed, a work in progress. We thank everyone who has helped create a safe, beautiful environment for our children to enjoy quality programs.</p></td>
